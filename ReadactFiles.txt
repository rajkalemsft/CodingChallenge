Imagine a (non-engineer) coworker has given you a large plaintext document redact_me.txt. 
This file contains certain sensitive words that need to be redacted from it. 
Write a program that will create a redacted version of this document, based on 
an additional plaintext banned_words.txt file.

Example input 'redact_me.txt':
======================================
I DO NOT LIKE green eggs and ham

Not in a box not with a fox
Not in a house not with a mouse


Example input 'banned_words.txt':

fox
egg
toybox
not


Example 'redacted' output:

_REDACTED_ in a box _REDACTED_ with a _REDACTED_
_REDACTED_ in a house _REDACTED_ with a mouse
