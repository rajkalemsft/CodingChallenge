Design a system that provides a more reliable view of an unreliable inventory system. The system would only need to support on team, so it only needs to serve a subset of the operations and data in the original service.

The search criteria 
location, product_id, quantity

Key-value lookup

Operations to support (from the user’s perspective)
•	read
•	consume


•	Other subsystem to update the inventory
•	Product and location static
•	QPS 10/S both read and write

Entities
•	WareHouse { WareHouseId, Name, LocationId} 
•	Location { LocationId, AddressDetails}
•	Product { ProductId, Name, Quantity}

API Consumers
•	 Software Systems 

API
•	Inventory/{warehouseId}/{ProductId} – > 
{
	WareHouseId,
	WareHouseName,
	ProductId,
	ProductName,
	AvailableQuantity
}


•	Inventory/Consume/{warehouseId}/{ProductId}/
{
	ProductId,
	Qty
}

Storage
•	NoSQL WarehosueId/ProductId

Before the new layer
new system:X -> 10
new system:X -> XXX
new system:X-5 -> XXX 
new system:X -> 10
old system:X+5 -> 15

After the new layer
new system:X -> 10
new system:X-5 -> 5
new system:X -> 5
old system:X+ 5 -> 10
new system:X -> 10

Reliability
- Load Balancer  → API Nodes  → 
  Storage API → Cache → NoSQL OR Talk to Old System

Read Flow 
- Load Balancer  → API Nodes  → 
  Storage API → Cache → NoSQL 

Write Flow

- Load Balancer  → API Nodes  → 
  Storage API → NoSQL  → Raise an update event with required data → Pub-Sub Processor  → Update the cache for a particular Warehouse or Prod

Sync Processor
– Modify the old system to raise an update event → This way new system aca consume and update required storage cache/nosql
– New system can query - pull options


NEw system -
P1 -  10 - 03:00:01  - O 10 - 03:00:01

5 -> P1 -  5 - 03:00:02:100  - O 15 - 03:00:02:150 → send an event addition of 5

P1 -  10 - 03:00:02:100       - O 15 - 03:00:02:150

5 -> P1 -  10 - 03:00:02:100  - O 15 - 03:00:02:99 → send an event addition of 5

P1 -  15 - 03:00:02:100       - O 15 - 03:00:02:100
